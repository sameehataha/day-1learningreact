            <ul className="facts">
                <li>Cats have a built-in "righting reflex" – if they fall, their flexible spine and inner ear balance system help them twist mid-air and land on their feet most of the time.</li>
                <li>They can’t taste sweetness 🍭 – unlike humans, cats lack the taste receptor for sugar. That’s why they don’t crave candy or sweet treats.</li>
                <li>Whiskers are super sensors – they’re not just cute! Whiskers detect air currents and help cats measure if they can fit into tight spaces.</li>
                <li>They purr for more than happiness – cats also purr when stressed, in pain, or even to self-heal, since purring vibrations promote bone and tissue regeneration.</li>
                <li>Cats “chirp” at birds 🐦 – when watching prey, cats sometimes make a strange chattering noise. Scientists think it’s a mix of excitement and frustration, or a way to mimic bird calls!</li>
